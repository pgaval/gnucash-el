        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>The check format file is used to tell gnucash how to print a check or checks onto a page of paper.  This file first describes the overall layout of a page (number of checks, orientation, etc) and then describes the layout of the specific items on a single check.  The file is organized as a typical Key/Value file used by many Linux applications.  Keys/values pairs are grouped into sections that begin with the group name enclosed in square brackets.</para>
        <para>GnuCash looks for check format files in two different locations when you bring up the check printing dialog.  The first location is typically /usr/share/gnucash/checks, where check files distributed with the application can be found.  The second location is the user private ~/.gnucash/checks directory.  Users may add check formats at any time (even while GnuCash is running) simply by dropping a new *.chk file in this directory.  The next time the check printing dialog is opened the new check format will appear in the list of available check formats.</para>
        <note>
          <para>Printing functions differently depending on the version of GTK that is installed on your system.  When GnuCash is using a version of GTK prior to 2.10 all offsets are measured from the lower left corner of the page or check.  When using GTK 2.10 or later, all offsets are measured from the upper left corner of the page or check.</para>

                  <entry>The guid is used to uniquely identify a check format to GnuCash.  It must be unique across the entire set of application supplied and user supplied check formats.  If you copy an application check file as the basis of your own check format, you must change this value.  The <emphasis>uuidgen</emphasis> program may be used to generate these identifiers.</entry>

                  <entry>This value specified the rotation of the entire page (in degrees) around the origin point. For gtk versions prior to 2.10, the origin point is in the lower left corner of the page and rotation values increase in the counter-clockwise direction.  For gtk version 2.10 and later, the origin point is in the upper left corner of the page and rotation values increase in the clockwise direction.

For gtk versions prior to 2.10, the origin point is in the lower left corner of the page and translation values increase moving up and to the right.  For gtk version 2.10 and later, the origin point is in the upper left corner of the page and translation values increase moving down and to the right.

These names represent the check positions starting from the top of the page and moving downward.  The names are presented verbatim in the check position list of the check printing dialog.

          <title>Check Items Group</title>
          <para>This section specifies the individual items that are printed on the check.  There is no limit to the number of items that may be present in this section, and any given type of item can be repeated multiple times.  This allows for the printing of checks that have a side stub, or for the one-per-page business checks that have both the check and multiple check stubs on the same page.  For example, to print the payee name on a business check and on both stubs, simply specify three payee items with differing print coordinates.</para>
          <para>Each key names in this section explicitly includes the item number to which it applies.  E.G. The key named <guilabel>Type_1</guilabel> applies to the first item to be printed, and the key <guilabel>Coords_3</guilabel> applies to the third item to be printed.  Item numbers start at one and increase sequentially.  Any gap in the numbering sequence is interpreted by GnuCash as the end of the item list.  Items are printed in the order of their item numbers, not in the order in which they appear in the file.</para>
          <para>Each item specified must include a type declaration.  The rest of the parameters for that item depend upon the particular type of that item.  See <xref linkend="check_table_types"></xref> for a list of valid item types and their required parameters.</para>

                  <entry>This field specifies the coordinates where the item should be placed on a check, and optionally also specifies the width and height of the item.  The numbers in order are the X and Y offset of the lower left corner of the item, and optionally the width and height of the item.  If the width is supplied then the height must also be supplied, so this field will always contain two or four numbers.  For gtk versions prior to 2.10, the origin point is in the lower left corner of the page and translation values increase moving up and to the right.  For gtk version 2.10 and later, the origin point is in the upper left corner of the page and translation values increase moving down and to the right.<note>Regardless of whether the origin is at the top or the bottom of the page, the coordinates always specify the lower left point of the item.</note></entry>

        <title>Creating Check Format Files</title>
        <para>Creating your own check format file is a fairly simple task.  The easiest way to start is to copy an existing check format file from the application directory (typically /usr/share/gnucash/checks) to the directory ~/.gnucash/checks.  Make sure to change the guid so the new file will be accepted by gnucash, and change the title to something descriptive.  Then change or add individual item fields as necessary.  You can also create a new check file by clicking the <guilabel>Save Format</guilabel> button on the "Custom format" page of the check printing dialog.</para>
        <note>
          <para>Key names are case sensitive.  If you're having problems with a check format file, ensure that all key names start with a capital letter and the rest of the name is in lower case.</para>
